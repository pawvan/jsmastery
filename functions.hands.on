7. Common Interview Questions on Functions
What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?

Function declarations are hoisted, while function expressions are not.
What is the difference between this in regular functions and arrow functions?

Regular functions have their own this, while arrow functions inherit this from the surrounding scope.
What are closures in JavaScript?

A closure is a function that "remembers" its lexical environment, meaning it has access to variables from the scope in which it was created, even after that scope has finished executing.
