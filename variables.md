Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, we use three types of variable declarations:

let – Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
const – Declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after initialization.
var – Declares a function-scoped variable (not commonly used in modern JavaScript).

Examples:

javascript
let name = "John";  // String variable
const age = 25;     // Constant variable
var isActive = true; // Boolean variable
