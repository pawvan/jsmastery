Data Types
JavaScript has several data types that determine the type of value a variable can hold:

Primitive Types:
String: A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
Number: A numeric value (integer or floating-point).
Boolean: A value that can be true or false.
undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
null: Represents an intentional absence of any value.
Symbol: A unique identifier (less commonly used).
Complex Type:
Object: A collection of key-value pairs (properties).
