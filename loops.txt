For Loop
The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations.
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
While Loop
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known, and it runs as long as the condition is true.let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);  // Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
}
Do-While Loop
The do...while loop runs at least once before checking the condition.
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); // Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
